| Term            | Array | Set  |
| :-------------- | :---- | :--- |
| Reading         | 1     | 1    |
| Searching       | n     | n    |
| Insert at start | n + 1 | 2n+1 |
| Insert at end   | 1     | n    |
| Delete at start | n-1   | n    |
| Delete at end   | 1     | 1    |

Ordered Array: Slower Insertion and Faster Search

- Linear search: For General Array
- Binary Search: For Ordered Array
